A simple app to save user notes in a text file. 
While learning to build this app you will learn the basic concepts of nodeJs


## Task 1: Create an file with name hello.txt with contents 'HelloWorld'. Save the file in the local system.

## Task 2: Append the text  'Hello World 2019' in the file hello.txt

## Task 6: How can we keep saving the contents in a single file and read it back as individual records?
csv, flat file or JSON

what is JSON. 

Explain in brief about JSON


## Summary 

Below are the few things we learned while developing the app

- Node Modules
- System Modules
- Third Party Modules
- Custom Modules


## Debugging Nodes Applications
Add the word debugger at the line where you need to inspect the code. 
To run the application using debug mode use node inspect app.js
Now open Chrome browser n browse to url chrome://inspect
